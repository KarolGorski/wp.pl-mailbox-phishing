# wp.pl-mailbox-phishing
Phishing of wp.pl mailbox access. Additional homework for my cybersecurity lessons at University.

Page cloned by HTTrack Tool. Script that saves data typed by user is written in PHP. It's on free Azure hosting. There is only php script here, because i don't want to publish sb's site :) Script is launched after signing button is pressed.

Works fine. 
Result: http://wp-login.azurewebsites.net/
