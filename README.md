# wp.pl-mailbox-phishing
Phishing of wp.pl mailbox access. Additional homework for my cybersecurity lessons at University.

Page cloned by HTTrack Tool. Script that saves data typed by user is written in PHP. I have put it on free Azure hosting. I have put only php script here, because i am afraid of publishing sb's site files :) It is launched after signing button is pressed.

Works fine. 
Result: http://wp-login.azurewebsites.net/
